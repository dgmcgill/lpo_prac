Search for terminal.app in your search function. 

# Some very helpful command line commands

`cd` changes directories; use tab to autocomplete

`pwd` tells you what directory you're in

`ls` tells you what files are in the current directory

`mkdir <directory_name>` creates a new directory with filename

`touch <filename>` creates a blank file with filename

`open <filename>` will open a file with filename

# Command line tools for git/github

`git status .` tells the status of all files in current directory. 

# Some habits to get into

No more spaces, use either underscore `_` or `-`.

Anything numbered (does it need to be numbered?) should start with the number of places expected for the number of files, e.g. less than 100 files starts with 01, not 1.

Use correct convention for dates: 2022-02-10


# Some other helpful stuff

You can set which program will open a file with `open` by going into finder, locating a file with the right extension, and then using "open with" to set the app that will open that kind of file.
