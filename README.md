Course Overview
===============

The overview includes an introduction to the course, guidelines on
grading, and required texts.

Introduction
------------

This course is the first of a three semester series of courses designed
to introduce you to the *practice* of research, particularly the applied
side of quantitative research. The goal of this course to help you to
prepare a paper that can be presented at a major research conference
and, hopefully, submitted to a journal for publication.

To accomplish this goal, you will choose from among publicly available
datasets. You will identify a research topic, then later a research
question. You will create a dataset using the publicly available
sources. By the end of the semester, you will have a properly formatted
and cleaned dataset, with auxiliary information from other sources
included. Next semester we will analyze this dataset. By the end of May,
you will complete a paper based on this analysis.

Along the way, you will develop skills that will be helpful in future
work using any kind of data. This class has a strong emphasis on using
programming skills to aid in the replication of work and to simplify
complex analyses.

Grading
-------

Evaluation for the course will be based on the following factors:

*Assignments: 50%*

There will be weekly assignments, which will be graded pass/fail. Late
assignments will not be accepted. These assignments will account for
half of your grade. Collaboration on assignments is fine, however, many
of the assignments will ask you to work with variables and datasets of
your own choosing.

*Summary Paper and Codebook: 50%*

At the end of the semester, you will need to present the results of your
data collection efforts, with a summary paper of no more than five pages
of text, accompanied by properly formatted tables and graphics. The
summary paper and codebook will be due on December 8. You will present
your work to the rest of the class on December 8.

Texts
-----

There are no required texts for this course. The course materials will
live on the github repository,
https://github.com/wdoyle42/lpo_prac. For each class session you'll
need to grab the notes, do file and data for that session. 

Software
--------

You need to have access to a working version of Stata, (at least v
16.0).

If you do purchase Stata, you will need at least Stata IC (standard
version). Vanderbilt has what’s called a gradplan with Stata under which
you can purchase the software at greatly reduced prices. Stata SE is a
more-powerful version of Stata that is useful for the larger datasets
many of you may be working with.

Honor Code 
----------

For this course, you are bound by the terms of the Peabody Honor System.
Any breach of academic honesty, including cheating, plagiarism, or
failing to report a known or suspected violation of the Code will be
reported to the Honor Council. In particular, papers must assign credit
to the sources you use. Material borrowed from another–quotations,
paraphrases, key words, or ideas–must be credited following appropriate
citation procedures (footnotes and bibliography). As mentioned above,
collaboration *is* permitted on assignments but *is not* permitted on
your summary paper and codebook.

If you have any doubts, please ask me for clarification. Uncertainty
about the application of the Honor Code does not excuse a violation.
