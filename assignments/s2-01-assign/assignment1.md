**Part 1**

Write a script that does the following:

1.  Takes a variable list (assumed to be a series of continuous variables) as its argument.

2.  Converts each continunuous variable into a series of dummy variables, one for each quartile.

3.  Returns dummy variables that are appropriately labeled (both as
    variables and values).

**Part 2**

Following the logic we went over in class, generate a simple mean of
your dependent variable, followed by the conditional mean of your
dependent variable over the levels of a continuous or ordinal
independent variable. Use 2, 4, and 10 categories. Then run a regression
and predict the dependent variable from your independent variable.
Generate a mean squared error for each type of prediction (unconditional
and conditional means, regression) and describe what you find.

Submit the results of part 1 and 2 as a do file, with appropriate
comments. 

Naming convention for this semester will be: `01_assignment_<yourlastname>.do`.
Therefore, if I was turning in this assignment, I would call it `01_assignment_doyle.do`.
